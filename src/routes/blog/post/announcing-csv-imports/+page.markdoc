We're introducing a new way to populate your Appwrite databases: **document imports from CSV files**.

Built on top of Appwrite's migration APIs, this feature makes it easy to bring in large datasets, seed collections, or migrate structured data—using nothing more than a CSV file.

Useful for migrating user data from external systems, importing inventory records, seeding test environments, or onboarding structured content such as FAQs.

## How it works

To get started, create a collection and define its attributes in the Appwrite Console. Your CSV file should follow a standard format:

- The first row must be a header containing attribute names that match your collection
- Each subsequent row represents a document, with values separated by commas
- You can include the `$id` column to assign custom document IDs

All required attributes must be present in the CSV, and Appwrite will validate each row before importing it.

## Uploading your CSV file

You can upload a new file during import or select an existing one from your project's storage bucket.
The Console provides a guided interface to help you select the CSV and link it to your target collection. Once uploaded, the import process begins immediately.

## Designed for scale

CSV imports are built to scale seamlessly with your data. Whether you're working with a small dataset or importing production-grade records, the system is designed to handle high volumes reliably and efficiently.

The import system performs per-row validation and runs as a background task, allowing it to handle large files efficiently. This ensures reliable performance across a range of scenarios—from lightweight configuration data to large-scale production imports.

## Automate with API and SDKs

You can also trigger imports programmatically using the Appwrite API or SDKs. This is useful for scripted workflows, automated CI/CD pipelines, or admin dashboards.

All you need is a CSV file in your project's storage and the target collection ID. The rest is handled by Appwrite's import system.
