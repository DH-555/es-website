We're excited to introduce another Appwrite Databases feature, **Bulk API**.

Explicitly designed to handle heavy write workloads, Bulk API dramatically improves performance by allowing multiple database operations in a single API call.

That means you can create, update, or delete multiple documents in one go.

Whether youâ€™re importing large datasets, performing batch updates, or cleaning out old records, Bulk API streamlines your workload, drastically cutting down the number of requests and enhancing your application's performance.
