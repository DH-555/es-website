We're excited to introduce Database Upsert in Appwrite.

That means you can now create or update a document in a single API call. If the document does not exist, it is created. If it does, it is updated. The server handles all the logic for you.

This feature simplifies your database interactions, can help to reduce the number of network calls and allow race-free writes.
