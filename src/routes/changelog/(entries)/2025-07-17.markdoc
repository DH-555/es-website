Introducing new Database feature: Opt-in relationship loading.

Previously, Appwrite automatically fetched related documents whenever a query was made. This often resulted in large JSON payloads containing data you didn't necessarily need, negatively impacting load times and overall app performance.

With Opt-in relationship loading, documents now only return their immediate fields by default. You explicitly specify exactly which relationships should be included in your queries. 

Hereâ€™s how this upgrade improves your workflow:
- Load only the data you need
- Reduce payload sizes
- Improve query performance
