Working with geo data usually means storing raw coordinates and writing custom logic that slows down as your dataset grows.

But now, you can build scalable geo workflows right out of the box.

## What's new:
- New column types: `Point`, `Line` and `Polygon`
- New index type: `Spatial`
- 12 new geo query operators: `crosses`, `notCrosses`, `distanceEqual`, `distanceNotEqual` and more.

## Benefits: 

- Native support for geo logic: Handle geofencing, routing, and compliance zones without custom hacks.
- Scales with your data: Spatial indexes keep queries fast even with a large volume of records.
- Simpler development: Reduce app-side complexity by keeping geo operations inside the database.

This update is live on Appwrite Cloud.
