Designing schemas typically requires starting from a blank table, defining every column manually, agreeing on naming conventions, and remembering to add indexes and common fields.

This release introduces AI-assisted schema generation to simplify that process.

## Whatâ€™s new

- Added **Database AI suggestions** in the Console
- Automatic column and index suggestions based on table name and context
- Example: Creating a table called `Orders` suggests columns `orderId`, `userId`, `totalAmount`, and `status`.

## Benefits:

- Faster setup: Define schemas in seconds instead of manually creating each column
- Consistency: Field names and types aligned across tables
- Best practices: Suggested indexes and common fields included by default
- Flexibility: Suggestions can be reviewed, modified, or skipped before applying
