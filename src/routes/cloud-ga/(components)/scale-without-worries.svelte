                        We aimed to build a platform that could easily scale to 1M users overnight
                        without you breaking a sweat over scalability or finance. Today, we are
                        confident that we have reached this state as the numbers show, Appwrite
                        Cloud is stable for any project to grow rapidly unexpectedly.
                    </p>
                    <img class="rounded-3xl" src={Placeholder} alt="Placeholder" />
                    <p>
                        Building the infrastructure to support this goal wasn't easy, especially
                        with our vision of developing Appwrite Cloud from the ground up. However, we
                        pursued it to maintain control over both the platform's flexibility and the
                        pricing we offer. As accessibility is a key part of our mission, we knew
                        that providing a generous free tier and fair pricing was essential to
                        achieving that goal.

                    <p>
                        A cloud platform without the ability to scale is not much of a platform.
                        Weâ€™ve seen projects grow to xx users, executions, etc.
