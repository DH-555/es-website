title: Self-hosting
description: Set up your self-hosted Appwrite instance easily. Read the installation guide to configure and deploy Appwrite on your infrastructure for complete control.
---

Appwrite was designed from the ground up with self-hosting in mind. You can install and run Appwrite on any operating system that can run a [Docker CLI](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). Self-hosted Appwrite instances can be configured flexibly with access to the same features found on Appwrite Cloud.

{% info title="Upgrading from older versions" %}
If you are migrating from an older version of Appwrite, you need to follow the [migration instructions](/docs/advanced/self-hosting/update)

# Cloud vs Self-hosting {% #cloud-vs-self-hosting %}

Choose the deployment method that fits your needs.

| Feature | Appwrite Cloud | Self-hosting |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Setup | Zero setup | Manual setup required |
| Maintenance | Fully managed | You manage updates and scaling |
| Data control | Managed infrastructure | Full control over data location |
| Compliance | Built-in compliance | Configure for your requirements |
| Scaling | Automatic | Manual configuration |

# When to self-host {% #when-to-self-host %}

Self-hosting is ideal when you need data control or have specific compliance requirements.

**Consider self-hosting if:**
- You want to manage your own infrastructure
- You're a hobbyist or want to experiment with Appwrite in a playground environment
- You need to develop against a local instance of Appwrite

**Appwrite Cloud is recommended if:**
- You want to focus on building features, not managing infrastructure
- Your team lacks extensive DevOps experience
- You expect self-hosting to save costs (it often costs more when factoring in time and expertise)
