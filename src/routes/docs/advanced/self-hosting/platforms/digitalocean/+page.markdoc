{% section #connect-droplet step=1 title="Connect to your Droplet" %}

Use SSH to connect to your Droplet using the IP address provided in your DigitalOcean dashboard.

{% /section %}

{% section #install-prerequisites step=2 title="Install prerequisites" %}

1. **Update the system** packages to the latest versions
2. **Install Docker** following the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
3. **Install Docker Compose** from the [official releases](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases)
4. **Add your user to the docker group** to run Docker commands without sudo

{% /section %}

{% section #install-appwrite-droplet step=3 title="Install Appwrite" %}

1. **Create a directory** for your Appwrite installation
2. **Run the Appwrite installer** using the [Appwrite Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/appwrite/appwrite)
3. **Configure the installation** with these [recommended settings](/docs/advanced/self-hosting/installation)

{% /section %}

## Configure domain and SSL {% #droplet-ssl %}

{% section #point-domain step=1 title="Point domain to Droplet (optional)" %}

If using a custom domain:
1. Add an A record in your DNS provider pointing to your Droplet's IP address
2. Wait for DNS propagation (typically 15 minutes to 24 hours)

{% /section %}

{% section #setup-ssl step=2 title="Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt" %}

1. **Install Certbot** for automated SSL certificate management
2. **Configure Nginx** as a reverse proxy
3. **Obtain SSL certificates** using Certbot with the nginx plugin
4. **Enable automatic renewal** to maintain valid certificates

For detailed SSL setup instructions, see the [SSL certificates guide](/docs/advanced/self-hosting/configuration/tls-certificates).

{% /section %}

# Kubernetes deployment {% #kubernetes %}

Deploy Appwrite on DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) for container orchestration and high availability.

## Prerequisites {% #kubernetes-prerequisites %}

- DigitalOcean CLI (`doctl`) installed and configured
- `kubectl` installed locally
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts

## Create and deploy {% #create-deploy %}

{% section #setup-doks-cluster step=1 title="Set up DOKS cluster" %}

1. **Create a Kubernetes cluster** with these recommended settings:
   - **Version**: Latest stable Kubernetes version
   - **Node count**: 3 nodes minimum for high availability
   - **Node size**: s-2vcpu-4gb or larger
   - **Region**: Choose based on your target audience
2. **Configure kubectl** to access your cluster

For current DOKS setup procedures, refer to the [DigitalOcean Kubernetes documentation](https://docs.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/).

{% /section %}

{% section #deploy-to-k8s step=2 title="Deploy Appwrite" %}

1. **Create Kubernetes manifests** for:
   - Namespace for organizing components
   - ConfigMap for non-sensitive configuration
   - Secret for sensitive data like encryption keys
   - Deployment for the Appwrite application
   - Service for internal communication
   - Ingress for external access

2. **Configure the deployment**:
   - Memory: 512Mi minimum, 2Gi recommended
   - CPU: 250m minimum, 1000m limit
   - Storage: Configure persistent volumes as needed

3. **Apply manifests and verify**:
   - Deploy using kubectl
   - Monitor pod status and logs

# Production considerations {% #production %}

## Security best practices {% #security %}

**Data Protection**
- Enable automatic security updates
- Store sensitive environment variables securely
- Use DigitalOcean Spaces for external file storage

**Network Security**
- Use Cloud Firewalls to restrict access
- Deploy behind a Load Balancer for high availability
- Enable VPC for private networking between resources

**SSL/TLS Configuration**
- Use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates
- Configure automatic certificate renewal
- Implement proper HTTPS redirects

## Monitoring and backup {% #monitoring %}

**DigitalOcean Monitoring**
- Enable monitoring in your Droplet settings
- Configure alerts for CPU, memory, and disk usage
- Set up uptime monitoring for your domain

**Backup Strategy**
- Enable automatic snapshots for Droplets
- Store file uploads in DigitalOcean Spaces with versioning

For comprehensive backup procedures including database exports, storage volumes, and configuration files, see the [Backups page](/docs/advanced/self-hosting/production/backups).

**Performance Optimization**
- Use DigitalOcean CDN for static asset delivery
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Monitor and optimize database queries

# Troubleshooting {% #troubleshooting %}

**Common issues and solutions:**

**Droplet connectivity issues**
- Verify firewall rules allow required traffic
- Check SSH key configuration
- Ensure Droplet is running and accessible

**SSL certificate problems**
- Ensure domain DNS records point to correct IP address
- Verify web server configuration
- Monitor certificate expiration and renewal

**Performance issues**
- Monitor resource usage through DigitalOcean dashboard
- Consider upgrading Droplet size
- Review application logs for bottlenecks
