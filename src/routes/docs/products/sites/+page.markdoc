Appwrite Sites empowers developers to host and manage web applications seamlessly within the Appwrite ecosystem. Appwrite Sites provides a fast, scalable, and secure way to deploy web apps directly from source control, allowing for quick iterations and live updates. Each site has a dedicated URL, runs within its own isolated container, and can be configured with custom domains and environment variables.
