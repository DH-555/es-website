description: Discover how domains can be managed for an Appwrite Site
---

Each deployed site can have its own domain, which can be Appwrite-generated or custom. You can use this domain to consume web apps deployed on Appwrite Sites. Appwrite generates TLS certificates to enforce HTTPS on all Appwrite Sites domains. These domains are safe to use and access in production.

[Learn about Sites development >](/docs/products/sites/develop)

# Generated domains

1. In the Appwrite Console's sidebar, click **Sites**.
2. Under the **Domains** tab, you'll find the domain generated by Appwrite.

The domain usually has this format.

```bash
https://64d4d22db370ae41a32e.sites.appwrite.global
```

## Branch and Commit URLs

Additional to the site URL, Appwrite also generates a URL for the branch and commit that your site has been deployed from. The branch URL will remain consistent for all deployments made for code pushed to a specific branch, whereas the commit URL will be updated every time a new deployment is made via the Git integration (i.e. when code is pushed to your repo).

To find the branch and commit URLs of any deployment:

1. Navigate to your site on Appwrite Console.
2. Head to the **Deployments** tab and click on any deployment.
3. In the **Domains** section, click on the **+2** next to the mentioned domain.

# Add a custom domain

![Add custom domain](https://warm-tray-285.notion.site/image/attachment%3A96cb70d5-c8af-48f6-aa33-dd6cceac77d4%3Aimage.png?table=block&id=1c3fb53f-e82d-80f5-a450-ea3de6ce914f&spaceId=cf760f55-c352-4759-b494-006b8b294dbb&width=1420&userId=&cache=v2)

1. Navigate to your site in the Appwrite Console.
2. Head to the **Domains** tab and click on **Add domain**.
3. Input your domain and select one of the following:
    - **Active deployment**: Points the domain to the latest deployed version
    - **Git branch**: Points the domain to a specific branch on your repository
    - **Redirect**: Forwards all traffic from this domain to another URL
4. Copy the specified **CNAME** record and add it to your domain registrar.
5. Return to the Site settings and wait for verification status.

DNS records can take up to 48 hours to propagate. Once verified, the domain is ready to use.

{% info title="Additional note on domain redirection" %}

When you redirect an added domain to another URL, any additional path and queries will be ignored.

For example, if a domain `example.com` is set to redirect to `appwrite.io`, `example.com/docs?id=123` will also redirect to `appwrite.io`.
